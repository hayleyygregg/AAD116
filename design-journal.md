Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
------

Introduction to what we will be covering over the next 12 weeks.

Not being the biggest fan of history, I learned that I *need* to understand the history of design because it is what has influenced the designs of today and is what will make me a good designer. For example, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html" title="Find out about Johnathan Ive">Jonathan Ive</a>, the Senior Vice President of Design for Apple, who was influenced by <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams" title="Who is Dieter Rams?">Dieter Ram's</a> iconic design for Braun Radio 1961. This inspiration can be seen in apple products, for example, the ET 66 Calculator 1987 and the calculator for the iPhone. Jonathan Ive, and many other designers, swear by Ram's <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design" title="View Ten Principals">'Ten Principals for Good Design'</a> - so I must remind myself of them every now and then!

> “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.” - Confucius

I liked this quote as it not only describes me as I have a head like a sieve, but it explains how the best way to learn is through actively doing. Here is a good post with some more of Confucius quotes with written explanation <a href="http://www.myrkothum.com/confucius-says-the-top-10-quotes-by-confucius/" title="View more Confucius quotes">myrkothum.com</a>.

'Generative Design' was mentioned and I wasn't sure what it was, so I researched it to learn that it is a design method that uses Algorithms (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_Design" title="Find out more about Generative Design">Read more</a>) which is interesting to know for future projects. The importance of side projects was expressed as it is a great way to have fun and be creative, which could end up making you successful like <a href="http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer" title="Who's this?">Jessica Hische</a>!

We were given a 'Type Tile' project, a 3x3 grid of different typefaces from different periods of history. Being a big fan of typography, I am excited to get stuck into it! After class me and a small group of friends went to the library, which I'm ashamed to say I have not used before (my bad!) but I decided to get out of my comfort zone as I'm not a huge fan of reading and hire out some books which I thought could help inspire and educate me:

* The Elements of Typographic Style - Robert Bringhurst
* The alphabet and elements of lettering - Goudy, Frederic W.
* Graphis typography 2 : an international selection of the best in typographic

####Practical Lesson

I was introduced to 'two essential tools for Interaction Designers', <a href="https://atom.io" title="What's Atom?">Atom</a> & <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics" title="What's Markdown?">Markdown</a>. Experiencing coding in the past, Markdown is like heaven! It is a simple way to write whatever you want and using Atom it can be generated into HTML! I must admit it is odd after learning the HTML way...

To get used to Markdown, we were given a task of re-creating a PDF provided to us, below is my attempt (note no CSS is used):

* To complete this task I used the notes on markdown I had taken from the practical class and the websites https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/ and when I got stuck with blockquotes this site helped me: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

Ireland's rugged coast yields
=============================

Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
------------------------------

###by Robert Sténuit

*Illustrations by National Geographic*

*Photographer Bates Lilttlehales*

A wild north wind lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

> "In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada,the Girona was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called *Port na Spaniagh*, 'the port of the Spaniards'."

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

**Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:**

* A ornamental winged salamander
* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta
* Gilded brass dolphin
* Lapis lazuli cameos
* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats

**The Author:** Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in **"The Deepest Days"**, National Geographic, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.

Week 2

* Working with limitations will expand your creativity e.g. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/wp9p" title="About Album">Nils Fraham - Screws</a>

###Branding

* Keep it simple - less is more
* Always refer back to the brief
* Sketch initial ideas - quicker than computer

###Cave Paintings

We were shown 'The Panel of Hands' which were cave paintings in Spain where paint was blown over the hand while it was pressed against stone. This sparked an idea in my mind for a little experiment/side project! We were also shown cave paintings where dots had been used to create an image - this related to the design fundamental 'point' we had been learning this week! Through research it was discovered these paintings are thought to be 'the earliest examples of pointillism', an example of this type of painting is <a href="http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/chauvet/red_dots_panel.php" title="View source of information">'Red Dots Panel'</a>.

We looked at proportioning e.g. the Vitruvian Man & the Golden Ratio which is very important for giving a design balance and beauty. Through research I discovered that the Golden Ratio is also seen in nature, art and architecture such as 'The Last Supper' painting, the 'Great Pyraminds' in Egypt and 'The Parthenon' in Greece (<a href="http://www.goldennumber.net/golden-section/" title="View source">Source of information</a>).

The Golden Ratio can also be seen in logos such as Apple and Twitter, and we were shown the <a href="http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/seed-logo/" title="View the logo">logo design</a> of 'Seed Media Group' that Stefen Sagmeister created using the Golden Ratio and nature as inspiration. It too, reminded me of the design fundamental, point, as it is just circles! I really like how Sagmeister also created variations of the logo using different colours, for example, the business cards are pixel-like portraits of the employees through using various coloured dots.

I refreshed my memory by re-reading '<a href="http://typecast.com/blog/contrast-through-scale" title="View article">Contrast Through Scale</a> by Christopher Murphy' which explains how we can use these tools to define a hierarchy to guide the reader's eye through content on a page and provide a visual balance. The websites <a href="http://modularscale.com" title="View">modularscale.com</a> and <a href="http://type-scale.com" title="View">type-scale.com</a> are two handy ways of calculating the scale of type to provide that balance.

Through an over view of the <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2010/08/07/where-does-the-alphabet-come-from/" title="View website">history of the alphabet/written word</a>, I learned that the written word developed from pictorial to abstract and the Trajan typeface was based on the inscription of Roman square capitals on Trajan's Column. In an activity naming the fonts on screen during the lecture I came across some fonts that interested me:

* <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Raden_Segara_(Madurese_in_Javanese_script-published_in_1890)_(cropped).jpg" title="View font">Javanese Script</a>

* <a href="http://www.fonts2u.com/ws-simple-gallifreyan.font" title="View font">Galafren</a> - (CIRCLES!)

* <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/americas/2012/10/james-evans-and-the-cree-syllabary.html" title="View font">Cree syllabics by James Evans</a>

We looked at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_books" title="More info">history of books</a> and through research I discovered various materials that were used to write on , such as wooden tablets, silk, shell, bone and dried palm tree leaves. I learned that the book developed from writing on clay tablets, to Papyrus (in Egypt), Bamboo (in East Asia - for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War" title="View">The Art of War</a>), which was replaced by Parchment and finally Paper in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex" title="What's codex?">codex</a> replaced the scroll.

Moving on to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript" title="Find out more">Illuminated Manuscripts</a> we looked at the conservation of books, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria" title="Find out more">Library of ALexandria</a> being mentioned which was 'one of the largest and most significant' that became famous for being burned to the ground destroying many scrolls and books.

Scriptoriums were another form of conserving books as they were a place monks would copy and decorate manuscripts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells" title="Find out more">The Book of Kells</a> is an example of a famous Illuminated Manuscript, which inspired ideas for the 'Type Tile' project.

With the increased demand of distribution of books, the method of printing needed to develop in order to be faster and more efficient, which brings us to the topic of next week's lecture.

###An Introduction to Github

Our practical lesson was learning about Github.

I learned that Github can be a storage space which allows for collaborative work to make changes without the worry of overwriting projects.

<b>Notes:</b>

* Repo (Repository) = storage space where you can store projects
* Commit = a snapshot of code at a particular point in time that can have a descriptive message to help you when returning to a project at a later time
* Push = putting commits to your Github Repo
*Pull = bringing Github files back to the local computer
*Fork = copy a Repo from one account to another
* Branching = Splitting code in a way that allows you to work on a version separate from the master to avoid ruining the original
* Star = Bookmarking

We were then taken through step by step to get a version of a 'Hello World' Page Tim created which we then had to personalise.

####Changing Background

Using a wallpaper I designed applying the design fundamental of Line that I had uploaded onto my Flickr account, I viewed all download sizes of the image and copied the URL of the image size I wanted to use. This was then added to the CSS code of my <a href="http://hayleyygregg.github.io" title="View Personal Page">hayleyygregg.github.io</a> page.

As a homework, we were then asked to personalise our page to include a small piece to introduce ourselves. (Check out Week 3)

At first I hadn't a clue what to write about myself! I felt so boring! I wanted to try and get personality across in what I wrote, stuck, I took to Google and started looking at two Illustrators I idolise <a href="http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer">Jessica Hische</a> & <a href="http://jilldehaanart.prosite.com/10649/about-me">Jill De Hann</a>.

Jessica's about me page is quite long and detailed, Jill's is short and fun. I felt Jessica's was the type of about me page I would have when I have more experience where I can write about the type of work I have done, which is difficult with no history...

I found a good website which helped me to write my Bio : http://99u.com/articles/7025/the-resume-is-dead-the-bio-is-king. Another site, which helped me improve my opening paragraph was http://www.ambitcreativegroup.com/portfolio/designer-bios because these Bio's included what inspires them and what they are passionate about.

Looking back at what I've wrote I know in the near future I will need to update this to include more about me, how I got to where I am today etc. But for now, I feel what I have written is just enough.



Week 3
------

> The printing press is considered one of the most important inventions in history. This device has made it possible for books, newspapers, magazines, and other reading materials to be produced in great numbers - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_printing" title="View source">Wikipedia</a>

'Movable Type' was first developed in China, 1040. In 1450  Johannes Gutenberg improved the system casting type using a matrix and hand mould which produced quick, low cost, high quality prints.

The first book printed using 'Movable Type' was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible">The Gutenburg Bible</a>.

* I learnt that the term leading came from the method of casting type "when thin strips of lead were inserted into the forms to increase the vertical distance between lines of type" - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading" title="View source">Wikipedia</a>

<!-- Insert image http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_printing#mediaviewer/File:Metal_movable_type.jpg-->

Albrecht Durer was mentioned who used Woodcuts as one of the methods for his work. It was mentioned that he added his monogram onto some of his work, which can be seen as an early form of branding.

He created a book, 'A Course in the Art of Measurement with Compass and Ruler' which goes into depth about font & proportions, which could be an interesting read.

Due to the revolution of printing, varieties of fonts began to be created. We looked at fonts by Type designers that are still popular and used by Typographers today:

* Nicolas Jenson
* Francesso Griffo (who designed the first italic typeface!)
* Claud Garamond
* William Caslon
* John Baskerville
* Giambattista Bodoni

 The end of the 1800s seen the birth of Sans-Serif fonts and Vincent Figgins Slab-Serif font, Antique.


[To Be Continued...]

Hired books:

* Stop stealing sheep & find out how type works - Erik Spiekermann & E.M. Gi
* Just my type: a book about fonts - Simon Garfield

###Personalising Github Page

At first I hadn't a clue what to write about myself! I felt so boring! I wanted to try and get personality across in what I wrote, stuck, I took to Google and started looking at two Illustrators I idolise <a href="http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer">Jessica Hische</a> & <a href="http://jilldehaanart.prosite.com/10649/about-me">Jill De Hann</a>.

Jessica's about me page is quite long and detailed, Jill's is short and fun. I felt Jessica's was the type of about me page I would have when I have more experience where I can write about the type of work I have done, which is difficult with no history...

Another site, which helped me improve my opening paragraph was http://www.ambitcreativegroup.com/portfolio/designer-bios because these Bio's included what inspires them and what they are passionate about.

After writing my Bio I discovered examples  provided to get inspiration from, I liked <a href="http://www.sazzy.co.uk/about/">Sarah Paramenter's</a> 'About' Page as it has a type of FAQs section which I thought was a good and fun idea.

Looking back at what I've wrote I know in the near future I will need to update this to include more about me, my story of how I got to where I am today etc. But for now, I feel what I have written is just enough.

###Adding Images using Markdown
Starting my AAD16 blog, I wondered how images are added to Github. I thought this would be shown to us at a later date, but I decided to do a little research to see if I could find anything to help me...

I found the handy site https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics that also shows how to use Markdown Syntax. Github also provided a help page (https://help.github.com/articles/adding-images-to-wikis/) which matched the Markdown Syntax the 'daringfireball' site gave.

Now that I know how, when I get time, I will start adding images to this blog!

###Century of Change

The 1800s seen a huge change in society and technology, with the inventions of the Telephone by Alexander Bell (1876), George Eastman the founder of Kodak (1888) and the Escalator by Jesse Reno (1899).

The first recorded photograph, 'View from the Window at Le Gras' was by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826. Through research I discovered it was through trail and error of a scientific/chemical-type process that Niépce created the first photograph:

> "In 1826, through a process of trial and error, he finally came upon the combination of bitumen of Judea (a form of asphalt) spread over a pewter plate. When he let this petroleum-based substance sit in a camera obscura for eight hours without interruption, the light gradually hardened the bitumen where it hit, thus creating a rudimentary photo. He "developed" this picture by washing away the unhardened bitumen with lavender water, revealing an image of the rooftops and trees visible from his studio window. Niépce had successfully made the world's first photograph."

Source [hrc.utexas.edu](http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/windows/southeast/joseph_nicephore_niepce.html)

Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre is seen as the father of photography, inventing 'the first publicly announced photographic process', Daguerrotype. (Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype))

<!--add image http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Daguerre#mediaviewer/File:Boulevard_du_Temple_by_Daguerre.jpg -->

>"Boulevard du Temple, taken by Daguerre in 1838 in Paris, includes the earliest known candid photograph of a person. The image shows a street, but because of the over ten-minute exposure time the moving traffic does not appear. At the lower left, however, a man apparently having his boots polished, and the bootblack polishing them, were motionless enough for their images to be captured."

Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Daguerre#mediaviewer/File:Boulevard_du_Temple_by_Daguerre.jpg)

###Photographers of War

> "Mathew B. Brady was one of the most celebrated 19th-century American photographers, best known for his portraits of celebrities and his documentation of the American Civil War. He is credited with being the father of photojournalism."

Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Brady)

<!--mathew brady images-->

Roger Fenton was a photographer of the 1855 Crimean War:

<!--images-->

Paul Seawright was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum, London. "Hidden was a response to the war in Afghanistan in 2002. Photographs of minefields and battlesites acknowledge that almost everything in the conflict was hidden or invisible." (Source: [paulseawright.com](http://www.paulseawright.com/hidden/))

<!--photos-->


###Moving Pictures

It was discovered that motion in pictures can be seen as far back as Cave Paintings, where it is believed some paintings intend to show movement to tell a story.(Source: [openculture.com] (http://www.openculture.com/2012/06/european_cave_art_was_it_the_earliest_form_of_cinema.html))

<!--images  in locations Lascaux, Les Trois-Frères, Chauvet-->

Moving on, The Mutoscope, invented by Herman Castler, became a form of movement in images by leafing through pictures on a wheel (like flipping a book) creating the illusion of motion.

<!--image-->

Researching the Zoetrope, I discovered the Phenakistoscope which was created in 1841, before the Mutoscope.


<!--image http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenakistoscope-->

The Zoetrope had similarities to this, only it allowed several people to view the animation at the same time.


<!--image-->


The 2009 [advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERxMrMXTquk) for Sony was inspired by the history of motion picture, creating 'the worlds biggest Zoetrope', 'The Braviadome'.



(The content below sourced from [csa.com](http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/film/review2.php))

Through researching motion pictures I discovered the idea began with the use of static photographic stills projected rapidly. For example, the 'magic lantern', an early version of a slide projector that allowed images to pass through a lens with the use of light, supplied by a kerosene lamp. The inventor of the magic lamp was debated, but credited to Charles Hugyens.

Projection machines took a long time to become advanced enough to be able to simulate motion, but the magic lamp influenced various versions in the 1830s, such as the Stroboscope by Simon Ritter von Stampfer of Vienna and the Kinematoscope by Coleman Sellers in 1861.


####The first Motion Picture

> "The concept of creating continuous live action did not occur until 1872 when British photographer Eadweard Muybridge was hired by California governor Leland Stanford to win a bet that all four hooves of a race horse left the ground when it ran."


Through research I discovered that Muybridge "developed the idea of capturing the motion through setting 24 cameras in a row along a track, attaching a string to each camera shutter, and by an electric device, setting the cameras in successive operation as the horse passed... mounting the photographs on a Phenakisticope and projecting them through a magic lantern."


In 1882 Emile Reynaud’s improved this discovery using the invention of the Praxinoscope (successor of the zoetrope) that she used to project Muybridge’s images from behind a screen. The same year, Etienne Jules Marey Developed 'a single camera that could shoot multiple images, taking 12 photographs in one second'.

I discovered that Thomas Edison was the first to create a music video in 1888 combining a visual companion to the phonograph, inspired by the work of Muybridge and Marey.

The first ever motion picture shot was the 'Roundhay Garden Scene by Louis Aimé Le Prince' which was created by two receivers, both with a single lens and a take-up spool for paper negatives which were exposed in the summer of 1888.

However, Cinematography is credited to the Lumiere Brothers who 'invented their own device combining camera with printer and projector' calling it 'the Cinématographe.' Source: [earlycinema.com](http://www.earlycinema.com/pioneers/lumiere_bio.html)

###Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution changed everything, with higher demands for print, hand production was taken over by machines for mass production. It also seen Graphic Design come to form with the help of the Letterpress.

Letterpress printing produces a crisp, tangable bite in the type on a page that cannot be produced on screen. With hand production 'letters are not pictures of things', they are real things. Colour is chosen by eye, not catalogue number.

The Linotype machine was the standard machine used for printing newspapers, magazines and posters as it was faster than the Letterpress, producing lines of metal type at a time.

As a class, we were shown a short documentary on the Letterpress which explained how much thought and precision went to producing material.

> "A sixth of an inch counts"

I found this short clip interesting, it showed the distinctive style a Letterpress produces. I also found it interesting how a Maltese Cross was created using four Serif letter I's cut to fit together.

Now with programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator, there is not as much thought put into the design of some work as there was before, which is disappointing. Unfortunatly, it is inevitable that eventually the Letterpress will die, but I hope not for a long time yet, as the work it produces is too beautiful.

###Japonism
Japanese art influenced the European, especially impressionism. Artists influenced include:

* Claude Monet

<!--image-->

* Vincent van Gogh

<!--image-->


* Henri de Toulouse


<!--image-->


###Arts & Crafts Movement
This was a reaction against Industrialisation where thought was no longer being put into design. William Morris was a key figure in this movement encouraging artists to look to the past for inspiration.

Best known for pattern design, they show inspiration from medieval influences, for example, the design of Illuminated Manuscripts.


<!-- image of Wallpaper design, 'Trellis' 1862 -->

###Art Nouveau
This is a style of art inspired by nature, embarcing architecture, graphic art, interior design and decorative arts.

The poster by Alphonse Mucha for Sarah Bernhardt in 1896 shows the style of Art Nouveau.

<!-- image http://www.wikiart.org/en/alphonse-mucha/sarah-bernhardt-1896 -->

Alphonse Mucha was also influenced by Japanese woodcuts as most of his work was in black and white. Illustrator Aubrey Beardsley was also influenced by Japanese woodcuts.

###The Glasgow School

Made up of 'the Glasgow four':

* Margaret MacDonald
* Frances MacDonald
* Charles Mackintosh
* Herbert MacNair


The Glasgow School was the centre of creativity that contributed in the feilds of architecture, interior design, and painting in Art Nouveau. (Source - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_School))

The McDonald Sisters are renowned for work such as 'Drooko' a poster for an umbrella company:

<!-- image -->

Charles Mackintosh is seen as the main representative of Art Nouveau in the UK. He admired Japonism and incorporated these influences in his own style, the contrast between strong right angles and floral-inspired decorative motifs with subtle curves, known as 'the Mackintosh Rose' motif.

<!--image-->




###Vienna Secession
Formed by Austrian Artists in 1897, this movement included painters, sculptors, and architects. (Source - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Secession))

The key figure was Gustav Klimt. Researching him, I discovered he caused outcry over the paints he created from commission for decorating the celing of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna.

Nuda Veritas (1899) was a kind-of reaction to what happened in 1894 that had the quotation by Friedrich Schiller, "If you cannot please everyone with your deeds and your art, please only a few. To please many is bad." I actually like this quote as it is true!

I like The Beethoven Frieze (1902) by Klimt:

<!-- image http://www.secession.at/beethovenfries/geschichte_e.html -->

Other famous works of Klimt include The Kiss  and Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (1907) which I discovered both include gold leaf!

Eduard Scholz was a Typefounder in Vienna  in the 1900s. His work includes typefaces, Reklameschrift Secession and Zierschrift Monopol, which have the style of Art Nouveau. (Source [luc.devroye.org](http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-53223.html))

<!--images-->

###Expressionism

>Expressionism represents feeling in art and portrays mood rather than realism.

Expressionists include:

* “The Scream” by Edvard Munch

<!-- image -->

* Egon Schiele (Key figure)


* Oskar Kokoschka


###Modernism

Peter Behrens is seen as the father of Graphic Design, known for designing the corporate identity of AEG.

<!--image-->

His work has inspired many, including Dieter Rams. Modernism moved away from traditions towards a clean style more appropriate to the present time which also impacted typography with the introduction to San-Serif Typefaces.

###Practical

####Installing Github onto Desktop

First I downloaded Github for Mac http://mac.github.com then it was explained that we must clone a repo so that it is on our local machine. Then you are able to work on the local file offline at any time.

When you update a markdown file by saving it, the Github application automatically recognises this, then all I had to do to 'push' it onto my live Github was to hit 'Commit & Sync'. It was highlighted before pushing you can locally test that everything is working which is one advantage of this.

Now that we know how to push and pull things from our Github this means I can now push up images adding relative links instead of using an absolute path like we had been first shown in Week 2.

Its only Week 4 and I have already learned so much about Github. When we were first told as a class we would be using Github I was scared! I thought it would be so hard, but it's actually easier than I thought! I love how handy it is and because it uses Markdown it gets extra brownie points!
