Introduction to what we will be covering over the next 12 weeks.

Not being the biggest fan of history, I learned that I *need* to understand the history of design because it is what has influenced the designs of today. For example, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html" title="Find out about Johnathan Ive">Jonathan Ive</a>, the Senior Vice President of Design for Apple, who was influenced by <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams" title="Who is Dieter Rams?">Dieter Ram's</a> iconic design for Braun Radio 1961. This inspiration can be seen in apple products, for example, the ET 66 Calculator 1987 and the calculator for the iPhone. Jonathan Ive, and many other designers, swear by Ram's <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design" title="View Ten Principals">'Ten Principals for Good Design'</a> - so I must remind myself of them every now and then!
