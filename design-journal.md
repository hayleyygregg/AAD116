Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
------

Introduction to what we will be covering over the next 12 weeks.

Not being the biggest fan of history, I learned that I *need* to understand the history of design because it is what has influenced the designs of today and is what will make me a good designer. For example, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html" title="Find out about Johnathan Ive">Jonathan Ive</a>, the Senior Vice President of Design for Apple, was influenced by <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams" title="Who is Dieter Rams?">Dieter Rams</a> design for Braun Radio 1961. This inspiration can be seen in apple products, for example, the ET 66 Calculator (1987) and the calculator for the iPhone. Therefore, if it wasn't for Jonathan Ive discovering Dieter Rams, none of the iconic designs for Apple would have ever existed!


<!--image-->

Jonathan Ive, and many other designers, swear by Ram's <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design" title="View Ten Principals">'Ten Principals for Good Design'</a> - so I must remind myself of them every now and then!

> “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.” - Confucius

I liked this quote as it not only describes me as I have a head like a sieve, but it explains how the best way to learn is through actively doing. Here is a good post with some more of Confucius quotes with written explanation <a href="http://www.myrkothum.com/confucius-says-the-top-10-quotes-by-confucius/" title="View more Confucius quotes">myrkothum.com</a>.

'Generative Design' was mentioned and I wasn't sure what it was, so I researched it to learn that it is a design method that uses Algorithms (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_Design" title="Find out more about Generative Design">Read more</a>) which is interesting to know for future projects. The importance of side projects was expressed as it is a great way to have fun and be creative, which could end up making you successful like <a href="http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer" title="Who's this?">Jessica Hische</a>!

We were given a 'Type Tile' project, a 3x3 grid of different typefaces from different periods of history. Being a big fan of typography, I am excited to get stuck into it! After class me and a small group of friends went to the library, which I'm ashamed to say I have not used before (my bad!) but I decided to get out of my comfort zone as I'm not a huge fan of reading and hire out some books which I thought could help inspire and educate me:

* The Elements of Typographic Style - Robert Bringhurst
* The alphabet and elements of lettering - Goudy, Frederic W.
* Graphis typography 2 : an international selection of the best in typographic

####Practical Lesson

I was introduced to 'two essential tools for Interaction Designers', <a href="https://atom.io" title="What's Atom?">Atom</a> & <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics" title="What's Markdown?">Markdown</a>. Experiencing coding in the past, Markdown is like heaven! It is a simple way to write whatever you want and using Atom it can be generated into HTML! I must admit it is odd after learning the HTML way...

To get used to Markdown, we were given a task of re-creating a PDF provided to us, below is my attempt (note no CSS is used):

* To complete this task I used the notes on markdown I had taken from the practical class and the websites https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/ and when I got stuck with blockquotes this site helped me: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

Ireland's rugged coast yields
=============================

Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
------------------------------

###by Robert Sténuit

*Illustrations by National Geographic*

*Photographer Bates Lilttlehales*

A wild north wind lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

> "In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada,the Girona was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called *Port na Spaniagh*, 'the port of the Spaniards'."

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

**Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:**

* A ornamental winged salamander
* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta
* Gilded brass dolphin
* Lapis lazuli cameos
* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats

**The Author:** Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in **"The Deepest Days"**, National Geographic, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.

Week 2
------
* Working with limitations will expand your creativity e.g. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/wp9p" title="About Album">Nils Fraham - Screws</a>

###Branding

* Keep it simple - less is more
* Always refer back to the brief
* Sketch initial ideas - quicker than computer

###Cave Paintings

We were shown 'The Panel of Hands' which were cave paintings in Spain where paint was blown over the hand while it was pressed against stone. This sparked an idea in my mind for a little experiment/side project! (See Week 5!) We were also shown cave paintings where dots had been used to create an image - this related to the design fundamental 'point' we had been learning this week! Through research it was discovered these paintings are thought to be 'the earliest examples of pointillism', an example of this type of painting is <a href="http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/chauvet/red_dots_panel.php" title="View source of information">'Red Dots Panel'</a>.

We looked at proportioning e.g. the Vitruvian Man & the Golden Ratio which is very important for giving a design balance and beauty. Through research I discovered that the Golden Ratio is also seen in nature, art and architecture such as 'The Last Supper' painting, the 'Great Pyraminds' in Egypt and 'The Parthenon' in Greece (<a href="http://www.goldennumber.net/golden-section/" title="View source">Source of information</a>).

The Golden Ratio can also be seen in logos such as Apple and Twitter, and we were shown the <a href="http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/seed-logo/" title="View the logo">logo design</a> of 'Seed Media Group' that Stefen Sagmeister created using the Golden Ratio and nature as inspiration. It too, reminded me of the design fundamental, point, as it is just circles! I really like how Sagmeister also created variations of the logo using different colours, for example, the business cards are pixel-like portraits of the employees through using various coloured dots.

I refreshed my memory by re-reading '<a href="http://typecast.com/blog/contrast-through-scale" title="View article">Contrast Through Scale</a> by Christopher Murphy' which explains how we can use these tools to define a hierarchy to guide the reader's eye through content on a page and provide a visual balance. The websites <a href="http://modularscale.com" title="View">modularscale.com</a> and <a href="http://type-scale.com" title="View">type-scale.com</a> are two handy ways of calculating the scale of type to provide that balance.

Through an over view of the <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2010/08/07/where-does-the-alphabet-come-from/" title="View website">history of the alphabet/written word</a>, I learned that the written word developed from pictorial to abstract and the Trajan typeface was based on the inscription of Roman square capitals on Trajan's Column. In an activity naming the fonts on screen during the lecture I came across some fonts that interested me:

* <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Raden_Segara_(Madurese_in_Javanese_script-published_in_1890)_(cropped).jpg" title="View font">Javanese Script</a>

* <a href="http://www.fonts2u.com/ws-simple-gallifreyan.font" title="View font">Galafren</a> - (CIRCLES!)

* <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/americas/2012/10/james-evans-and-the-cree-syllabary.html" title="View font">Cree syllabics by James Evans</a>

We looked at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_books" title="More info">history of books</a> and through research I discovered various materials that were used to write on , such as wooden tablets, silk, shell, bone and dried palm tree leaves. I learned that the book developed from writing on clay tablets, to Papyrus (in Egypt), Bamboo (in East Asia - for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War" title="View">The Art of War</a>), which was replaced by Parchment and finally Paper in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex" title="What's codex?">codex</a> replaced the scroll.

Moving on to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript" title="Find out more">Illuminated Manuscripts</a> we looked at the conservation of books, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria" title="Find out more">Library of ALexandria</a> being mentioned which was 'one of the largest and most significant' that became famous for being burned to the ground destroying many scrolls and books.

Scriptoriums were another form of conserving books as they were a place monks would copy and decorate manuscripts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells" title="Find out more">The Book of Kells</a> is an example of a famous Illuminated Manuscript, which inspired ideas for the 'Type Tile' project.

With the increased demand of distribution of books, the method of printing needed to develop in order to be faster and more efficient, which brings us to the topic of next week's lecture.

###An Introduction to Github

Our practical lesson was learning about Github.

I learned that Github can be a storage space which allows for collaborative work to make changes without the worry of overwriting projects.

<b>Notes:</b>

* Repo (Repository) = storage space where you can store projects
* Commit = a snapshot of code at a particular point in time that can have a descriptive message to help you when returning to a project at a later time
* Push = putting commits to your Github Repo
*Pull = bringing Github files back to the local computer
*Fork = copy a Repo from one account to another
* Branching = Splitting code in a way that allows you to work on a version separate from the master to avoid ruining the original
* Star = Bookmarking

We were then taken through step by step to get a version of a 'Hello World' Page Tim created which we then had to personalise.

####Changing Background

Using a wallpaper I designed applying the design fundamental of Line that I had uploaded onto my Flickr account, I viewed all download sizes of the image and copied the URL of the image size I wanted to use. This was then added to the CSS code of my <a href="http://hayleyygregg.github.io" title="View Personal Page">hayleyygregg.github.io</a> page.

As a homework, we were then asked to personalise our page to include a small piece to introduce ourselves. (Check out Week 3)

At first I hadn't a clue what to write about myself! I felt so boring! I wanted to try and get personality across in what I wrote, stuck, I took to Google and started looking at two Illustrators I idolise <a href="http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer">Jessica Hische</a> & <a href="http://jilldehaanart.prosite.com/10649/about-me">Jill De Hann</a>.

Jessica's about me page is quite long and detailed, Jill's is short and fun. I felt Jessica's was the type of about me page I would have when I have more experience where I can write about the type of work I have done, which is difficult with no history...

I found a good website which helped me to write my Bio : http://99u.com/articles/7025/the-resume-is-dead-the-bio-is-king. Another site, which helped me improve my opening paragraph was http://www.ambitcreativegroup.com/portfolio/designer-bios because these Bio's included what inspires them and what they are passionate about.

Looking back at what I've wrote I know in the near future I will need to update this to include more about me, how I got to where I am today etc. But for now, I feel what I have written is just enough.



Week 3
------

> The printing press is considered one of the most important inventions in history. This device has made it possible for books, newspapers, magazines, and other reading materials to be produced in great numbers - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_printing" title="View source">Wikipedia</a>

'Movable Type' was first developed in China, 1040. In 1450  Johannes Gutenberg improved the system casting type using a matrix and hand mould which produced quick, low cost, high quality prints.

The first book printed using 'Movable Type' was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible">The Gutenburg Bible</a>.

* I learnt that the term leading came from the method of casting type "when thin strips of lead were inserted into the forms to increase the vertical distance between lines of type" - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading" title="View source">Wikipedia</a>

<!-- Insert image http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_printing#mediaviewer/File:Metal_movable_type.jpg-->

Albrecht Durer was mentioned who used Woodcuts as one of the methods for his work. It was mentioned that he added his monogram onto some of his work, which can be seen as an early form of branding.

He created a book, 'A Course in the Art of Measurement with Compass and Ruler' which goes into depth about font & proportions, which could be an interesting read.

Due to the revolution of printing, varieties of fonts began to be created. We looked at fonts by Type designers that are still popular and used by Typographers today:

* Nicolas Jenson
* Francesso Griffo (who designed the first italic typeface!)
* Claud Garamond
* William Caslon
* John Baskerville
* Giambattista Bodoni

 The end of the 1800s seen the birth of Sans-Serif fonts and Vincent Figgins Slab-Serif font, Antique.

It was explained that Typographers use the origins of type in order to inspire their own creations.

We then looked at designs by Jessica Hische, Marian Bantjes and Si Scott. Marian Bantjes [Portfolio](http://www.bantjes.com/project/fox-river-paper) on Fox River Paper show beautiful works, I love how sugar was used for one of her designs and I aim to find time to try it out for myself! I also love the incredible work of [Si Scott](http://siscottstudio.com/), I think he needs to be added to my list of people I'm inspired by!

Finally Stefan Sagmeister was mentioned as his work revolves around reacting against the computer. His book ['Things I have learned in my life so far'](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/things-i-have-learned-in-my-life-so-far/) was mentioned, so after class I had a look through it. It's pretty amazing, and some of his work inspired me and I hope to get a chance to try some ideas out! Sagmeister actually commissioned Bantjes to create a sugar piece to be included in his book using one of his quotes. ([See here](http://www.bantjes.com/project/stefan-sagmeister-sugar))

Sagmeister's ['Take it On'](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/sva-posters/) posters are amazing, using typography in a really unique way. He also is most famously known for getting a student to scrape words into him for his AIGA-Detroit Poster:

<!--image-->

Hired books:

* Stop stealing sheep & find out how type works - Erik Spiekermann & E.M. Gi
* Just My Type: a book about fonts - Simon Garfield

####Book Review

I first read the Stop stealing sheep book. It didn't take me long to read it all, but I found it very interesting and gained knowledge about how important typography is. I havn't read all of Just My Type yet, but my favourite Chapter was No. 6 'The Ampsersands Final Twist'. I learned that the Ampsersand is actually two letters (et) combined! I also learned finest Ampersand is by William Caslon and is hard to imitate. What I found interesting was the '[Coming Together](http://www.typesociety.org/fontaid/iv/)' project which is a font that consists of 483 differently designed ampsersands by designers all over the world! This inspired an idea of a side project also inspired by a project I found when I began to use Tumblr called [Project 365](http://project-three-sixtyfive.tumblr.com).

<!--side project create 1 ampersand every month inspired by tumblr dude -->

###Personalising Github Page

At first I hadn't a clue what to write about myself! I felt so boring! I wanted to try and get personality across in what I wrote, stuck, I took to Google and started looking at two Illustrators I idolise <a href="http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer">Jessica Hische</a> & <a href="http://jilldehaanart.prosite.com/10649/about-me">Jill De Hann</a>.

Jessica's about me page is quite long and detailed, Jill's is short and fun. I felt Jessica's was the type of about me page I would have when I have more experience where I can write about the type of work I have done, which is difficult with no history...

I found a good website which helped me to write my Bio : http://99u.com/articles/7025/the-resume-is-dead-the-bio-is-king. Another site, which helped me improve my opening paragraph was http://www.ambitcreativegroup.com/portfolio/designer-bios because these Bio's included what inspires them and what they are passionate about.

After writing my Bio I discovered examples  provided to get inspiration from, I liked <a href="http://www.sazzy.co.uk/about/">Sarah Paramenter's</a> 'About' Page as it has a type of FAQs section which I thought was a good and fun idea.

Looking back at what I've wrote I know in the near future I will need to update this to include more about me, my story of how I got to where I am today etc. But for now, I feel what I have written is just enough.

###Adding Images using Markdown
Starting my AAD16 blog, I wondered how images are added to Github. I thought this would be shown to us at a later date, but I decided to do a little research to see if I could find anything to help me...

I found the handy site https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics that also shows how to use Markdown Syntax. Github also provided a help page (https://help.github.com/articles/adding-images-to-wikis/) which matched the Markdown Syntax the 'daringfireball' site gave.

Now that I know how, when I get time, I will start adding images to this blog!



Week 4

###Century of Change

The 1800s seen a huge change in society and technology, with the inventions of the Telephone by Alexander Bell (1876), George Eastman the founder of Kodak (1888) and the Escalator by Jesse Reno (1899).

The first recorded photograph, 'View from the Window at Le Gras' was by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826. Through research I discovered it was through trail and error of a scientific/chemical-type process that Niépce created the first photograph:

> "In 1826, through a process of trial and error, he finally came upon the combination of bitumen of Judea (a form of asphalt) spread over a pewter plate. When he let this petroleum-based substance sit in a camera obscura for eight hours without interruption, the light gradually hardened the bitumen where it hit, thus creating a rudimentary photo. He "developed" this picture by washing away the unhardened bitumen with lavender water, revealing an image of the rooftops and trees visible from his studio window. Niépce had successfully made the world's first photograph."

Source [hrc.utexas.edu](http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/windows/southeast/joseph_nicephore_niepce.html)

Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre is seen as the father of photography, inventing 'the first publicly announced photographic process', Daguerrotype. (Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype))

<!--add image http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Daguerre#mediaviewer/File:Boulevard_du_Temple_by_Daguerre.jpg -->

>"Boulevard du Temple, taken by Daguerre in 1838 in Paris, includes the earliest known candid photograph of a person. The image shows a street, but because of the over ten-minute exposure time the moving traffic does not appear. At the lower left, however, a man apparently having his boots polished, and the bootblack polishing them, were motionless enough for their images to be captured."

Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Daguerre#mediaviewer/File:Boulevard_du_Temple_by_Daguerre.jpg)

###Photographers of War

> "Mathew B. Brady was one of the most celebrated 19th-century American photographers, best known for his portraits of celebrities and his documentation of the American Civil War. He is credited with being the father of photojournalism."

Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Brady)

<!--mathew brady images-->

Roger Fenton was a photographer of the 1855 Crimean War:

<!--images-->

Paul Seawright was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum, London. "Hidden was a response to the war in Afghanistan in 2002. Photographs of minefields and battlesites acknowledge that almost everything in the conflict was hidden or invisible." (Source: [paulseawright.com](http://www.paulseawright.com/hidden/))

<!--photos-->


###Moving Pictures

It was discovered that motion in pictures can be seen as far back as Cave Paintings, where it is believed some paintings intend to show movement to tell a story.(Source: [openculture.com] (http://www.openculture.com/2012/06/european_cave_art_was_it_the_earliest_form_of_cinema.html))

<!--images  in locations Lascaux, Les Trois-Frères, Chauvet-->

Moving on, The Mutoscope, invented by Herman Castler, became a form of movement in images by leafing through pictures on a wheel (like flipping a book) creating the illusion of motion.

<!--image-->

Researching the Zoetrope, I discovered the Phenakistoscope which was created in 1841, before the Mutoscope.


<!--image http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenakistoscope-->

The Zoetrope had similarities to this, only it allowed several people to view the animation at the same time.


<!--image-->


The 2009 [advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERxMrMXTquk) for Sony was inspired by the history of motion picture, creating 'the worlds biggest Zoetrope', 'The Braviadome'.



(The content below sourced from [csa.com](http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/film/review2.php))

Through researching motion pictures I discovered the idea began with the use of static photographic stills projected rapidly. For example, the 'magic lantern', an early version of a slide projector that allowed images to pass through a lens with the use of light, supplied by a kerosene lamp. The inventor of the magic lamp was debated, but credited to Charles Hugyens.

Projection machines took a long time to become advanced enough to be able to simulate motion, but the magic lamp influenced various versions in the 1830s, such as the Stroboscope by Simon Ritter von Stampfer of Vienna and the Kinematoscope by Coleman Sellers in 1861.


####The first Motion Picture

> "The concept of creating continuous live action did not occur until 1872 when British photographer Eadweard Muybridge was hired by California governor Leland Stanford to win a bet that all four hooves of a race horse left the ground when it ran."


Through research I discovered that Muybridge "developed the idea of capturing the motion through setting 24 cameras in a row along a track, attaching a string to each camera shutter, and by an electric device, setting the cameras in successive operation as the horse passed... mounting the photographs on a Phenakisticope and projecting them through a magic lantern."


In 1882 Emile Reynaud’s improved this discovery using the invention of the Praxinoscope (successor of the zoetrope) that she used to project Muybridge’s images from behind a screen. The same year, Etienne Jules Marey Developed 'a single camera that could shoot multiple images, taking 12 photographs in one second'.

I discovered that Thomas Edison was the first to create a music video in 1888 combining a visual companion to the phonograph, inspired by the work of Muybridge and Marey.

The first ever motion picture shot was the 'Roundhay Garden Scene by Louis Aimé Le Prince' which was created by two receivers, both with a single lens and a take-up spool for paper negatives which were exposed in the summer of 1888.

However, Cinematography is credited to the Lumiere Brothers who 'invented their own device combining camera with printer and projector' calling it 'the Cinématographe.' Source: [earlycinema.com](http://www.earlycinema.com/pioneers/lumiere_bio.html)

###Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution changed everything, with higher demands for print, hand production was taken over by machines for mass production. It also seen Graphic Design come to form with the help of the Letterpress.

Letterpress printing produces a crisp, tangable bite in the type on a page that cannot be produced on screen. With hand production 'letters are not pictures of things', they are real things. Colour is chosen by eye, not catalogue number.

The Linotype machine was the standard machine used for printing newspapers, magazines and posters as it was faster than the Letterpress, producing lines of metal type at a time.

As a class, we were shown a short documentary on the Letterpress which explained how much thought and precision went to producing material.

> "A sixth of an inch counts"

I found this short clip interesting, it showed the distinctive style a Letterpress produces. I also found it interesting how a Maltese Cross was created using four Serif letter I's cut to fit together.

Now with programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator, there is not as much thought put into the design of some work as there was before, which is disappointing. Unfortunatly, it is inevitable that eventually the Letterpress will die, but I hope not for a long time yet, as the work it produces is too beautiful.

###Japonism
Japanese art influenced the European, especially impressionism. Artists influenced include:

* Claude Monet

<!--image-->

* Vincent van Gogh

<!--image-->


* Henri de Toulouse


<!--image-->


###Arts & Crafts Movement
This was a reaction against Industrialisation where thought was no longer being put into design. William Morris was a key figure in this movement encouraging artists to look to the past for inspiration.

Best known for pattern design, they show inspiration from medieval influences, for example, the design of Illuminated Manuscripts.


<!-- image of Wallpaper design, 'Trellis' 1862 -->

###Art Nouveau
This is a style of art inspired by nature, embarcing architecture, graphic art, interior design and decorative arts.

The poster by Alphonse Mucha for Sarah Bernhardt in 1896 shows the style of Art Nouveau.

<!-- image http://www.wikiart.org/en/alphonse-mucha/sarah-bernhardt-1896 -->

Alphonse Mucha was also influenced by Japanese woodcuts as most of his work was in black and white. Illustrator Aubrey Beardsley was also influenced by Japanese woodcuts.

###The Glasgow School

Made up of 'the Glasgow four':

* Margaret MacDonald
* Frances MacDonald
* Charles Mackintosh
* Herbert MacNair


The Glasgow School was the centre of creativity that contributed in the feilds of architecture, interior design, and painting in Art Nouveau. (Source - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_School))

The McDonald Sisters are renowned for work such as 'Drooko' a poster for an umbrella company:

<!-- image -->

Charles Mackintosh is seen as the main representative of Art Nouveau in the UK. He admired Japonism and incorporated these influences in his own style, the contrast between strong right angles and floral-inspired decorative motifs with subtle curves, known as 'the Mackintosh Rose' motif.

<!--image-->




###Vienna Secession
Formed by Austrian Artists in 1897, this movement included painters, sculptors, and architects. (Source - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Secession))

The key figure was Gustav Klimt. Researching him, I discovered he caused outcry over the paints he created from commission for decorating the celing of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna.

Nuda Veritas (1899) was a kind-of reaction to what happened in 1894 that had the quotation by Friedrich Schiller, "If you cannot please everyone with your deeds and your art, please only a few. To please many is bad." I actually like this quote as it is true!

I like The Beethoven Frieze (1902) by Klimt:

<!-- image http://www.secession.at/beethovenfries/geschichte_e.html -->

Other famous works of Klimt include The Kiss  and Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (1907) which I discovered both include gold leaf!

Eduard Scholz was a Typefounder in Vienna  in the 1900s. His work includes typefaces, Reklameschrift Secession and Zierschrift Monopol, which have the style of Art Nouveau. (Source [luc.devroye.org](http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-53223.html))

###Expressionism

>Expressionism represents feeling in art and portrays mood rather than realism.

Expressionists include:

* “The Scream” by Edvard Munch

<!-- image -->

* Egon Schiele (Key figure)


* Oskar Kokoschka


###Modernism

Peter Behrens is seen as the father of Graphic Design, known for designing the corporate identity of AEG.

<!--image-->

His work has inspired many, including Dieter Rams. Modernism moved away from traditions towards a clean style more appropriate to the present time which also impacted typography with the introduction to San-Serif Typefaces.

###Practical

####Installing Github onto Desktop

First I downloaded Github for Mac http://mac.github.com then it was explained that we must clone a repo so that it is on our local machine. Then you are able to work on the local file offline at any time.

When you update a markdown file by saving it, the Github application automatically recognises this, then all I had to do to 'push' it onto my live Github was to hit 'Commit & Sync'. It was highlighted before pushing you can locally test that everything is working which is one advantage of this.

Now that we know how to push and pull things from our Github this means I can now push up images adding relative links instead of using an absolute path like we had been first shown in Week 2.

Its only Week 4 and I have already learned so much about Github. When we were first told as a class we would be using Github I was scared! I thought it would be so hard, but it's actually easier than I thought! I love how handy it is and because it uses Markdown it gets extra brownie points!







Week 5

###Influence of Modern Art

Modern Art moved away from the traditions of the past and towards experimentation in abstract forms.


> Modern art begins with the heritage of painters like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec all of whom were essential for the development of modern art

####Cubism

Source of Information: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism)

This was an influential movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture.

> In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form — instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.

It is claimed that Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon was considered a major step in the movement to Cubism. This painting was influenced by African art which approached the human figure in an abstarct form. We can see this link through the features in two of the women in the painting who have African mask faces.

<!--pic http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism#mediaviewer/File:Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon.jpg-->

Therefore Picasso is seen as one of the key figures of the early development of Cubism and Modern art. Two other artists inspired by African art include Paul Gauguin and Henri Matisse.

<!--violin and candlestick 1910 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism#mediaviewer/File:Violin_and_Candlestick.jpg-->

Georges Braque played a role in the development of Cubism, inspired by Picasso. He studied the effects of light, perspective and the technical means that painters used to represent these effects. (Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Braque))

Paul Cézanne is seen as one of the key figures that influenced the development of Cubism, advocating the idea that nature can be reduced to three solids; a cube, sphere and cone. It was this theory that Picasso based his first cubist paintings on.

<!--paul c http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Paul_Cézanne_169.jpg-->

Characteristics of Cubism include:

* Flat/Geometric shapes
* Block Colour
* Different Viewpoints
* Structured/Abstract design


David Hockney's work has links to Cubism, such as his experiment with photography where combined “Polaroid photographs of one subject taken over an extended time and from several angles.” (Source: [npg.si.edu](http://www.npg.si.edu/cexh/artnews/hockney.htm))

<!--image http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gDOIaiibvRo/UQeLaTJ8Q7I/AAAAAAAAWD0/V57gE7KrwCI/s640/10_markoncain1.jpg-->





Roy Lichtenstein developed a Pop-art style by 'experimenting with cartoon images from comic books, advertisements, and other popular imagery.' His work varied from abstract to figurative as he was developing his style, the elements that made his work instantly recognisable included:

* Blown up images (either directly from or inspired by comic strips or newspaper ads)
* Primary colors
* Benday Dots
* Black outlines


Peace Through Chemistry, one of Lichtenstein's works, is seen as a play on Cubist composition.

####Plakastil


> “In German, Plakatstil means 'poster style'.  The characteristics of this art style are the joining of one produce image with minimal bold lettering... Bernhard’s trademark is simplicity.  His style consists of a flat color background combined with flat color shapes to illustrate the product and the product name.”

Source: [designmylife.org](http://www.designmylife.org/?p=1938)

Lucian Bernhard was the man that influenced the Plakastil style when he entered a poster contest for the Priester Match Company that won first prize due to its rare simplicity.

<!--Priestler match poster-->


He also designed many typefaces, such as Bernhard Fashion. We were shown a poster created in 2013 by Merle Perle that uses this typeface. I love it!


![Poster](images/bfashion.jpg)


Source: [luc.devroye.org](http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27018.html)

An example of a contemporary version of a Plakastil poster that also shows a form of Data Visualisation is the 'Scoreline' project by Adrian Newell which shows Thierry Henrys 226 individual goals scored for Arsenal:


<!--image-->

Newell also created a poster for Nike which involved him using a shoe print to create letters, leading to a typeface called 'make Your Mark':

<!--images-->


####Minimal Love

I love the Minimalist style! I find its simplicity really interesting, below show some of my favourite designs:

I like the designs I found on Google Images ([sharenator.com](http://www.sharenator.com/Minimalist_Film_Posters/#/6.html)) because they relate to Point, Line, Plane.

####Propaganda

A form of advertising that provoked emotion, the most well-known has to be the 1915 millitary recruiting poster by Alfred Leete featuring Lord Horatio Kitchener, British secretary of war, pointing directly at the viewer:

<!--image-->

Some Propaganda used a sentimental approach, such as Savile Lumley's 1914, “Daddy, what did YOU do in the Great War?” which used guilt as the motivation for people to join.

Another popular Propaganda was the American version of the Kitchener poster featuring James Montgomery Flagg:

<!--image-->

There are many imitations of the Kitchener poster, such as Colmans:

<!--image-->

####Futurism

Originating in Italy, Futurism was a movement that embraced Industrialism, celebrating themes associated with contemporary concepts of the future such as violence, machinery and speed.

<!--Abstract Speed and Sound 1913-1914 by Giacomo Balla-->


####Calligrams - Visual Poetry

Guillaume Apollinaire is an example of visual poetry as he used the arrangements of words in a poem to complement the meaning.

<!--image-->


Lewis Carroll's 1866 image for 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is another example:

<!--image-->


####Dada

Dadaists were Anti-art and Anti-War, questioning what art was. An example is the collage 'Arranged According to the Laws of Chance' by Jean Arp who mocked artists by dropping small pieces of paper onto a large sheet of paper, attaching them where they had fallen and then calling it 'art'.

<!--image-->

There were many key figures in this movement:

The scandalous work of Marcel Duchamp, who turned a urinal upside down and called it Fountian (1917) and drew a moustache and beard on the Mona Lisa (L.H.O.O.Q. 1919):

<!--images-->


Hannah Höch, an originator of photomontage, an example of her work is the well known  'Cut with the Kitchen Knife through the Beer-Belly of the Weimar Republic', 1919:

<!--image-->


Raoul Hausmann, who would find objects from a number of places and then put them together in a collage, such as; ABCD 1923–24:


<!--image-->


Kurt Schwitters, who took a similar approach to Hausmann:


<!--image-->


Schwitters also designed and published periodicals, such as Merz which had a Dada theme. It allowed him to discover typography and structured approaches:



<!--image-->


#####Contempry Approach

Jamie Reids promotional designs for The Sex Pistols are influenced by the Dada style and are seen as 'scandalous' as one includes a picture of the Queen:



<!--image-->


####Surrealism

Using juxtapositions and optical illusions to play with the viewer's mind. An example is Salvador Dali, one of his most recognisable works is 'The Persistence of Memory' 1931:


<!--image-->


I like 'Swans Reflecting Elephants':


<!--image http://gendermodernism.wordpress.com/exercises/exercise-2-surrealist-visual-art/ -->

Dali also brought surrealism into the film world, designing the set and 'Dream Scene' in Hitchcock's Spellbound 1945:

<!--image of eyes http://www.theculturist.com/home/tag/dream-sequence-from-vertigo-->


Paul Klee was inspired by Surrealism, along with many other movements such as Cubism:

<!--image-->


I came across a 2014 artical of Surrealistic Photos by Jean-Yves Lemoigne, I like his “Urban Legends series because the man reminds me of a Unicorn:

<!--image http://inspire.adobe.com/2014/3/1/surrealistic_photos_of_jean_yves_lemoigne.html-->


####Art Deco

A movement that embraced the Industrial Revolution, characterized by structured/geometric design and rich colours. An example of Art Deco is the “Dubo Dubon Dubonnet” (1932) poster by Cassandre:

<!--image-->

> The Art Deco movement was used as the basis for a design revamp of the London Underground in the 1930s. It influenced every aspect of design - from posters, trains, stations to the headquarters of the system at 55 Broadway - to create a modern, forward-looking transport system.


Source: [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/the-london-underground-and-art-deco/9304.html)


####London Underground

Between Edward Johnston and Eric Gill, the 'Johnston' typeface was created and'circulated as a lettering guide for sign-painters and also made into wood and metal type for posters, signs, and other publicity materials used throughout London's transport network.' (Source: [wired.co.uk](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/16/london-underground-typeface))


<!--image of roundel http://www.ltmcollection.org/roundel/about/detailedhistory.html?IXpage=2&_IXSESSION_=mu_gOjV0Xzl&IXenlarge=i0000ouu -->


The Underground Map has developed through the years, from a geographic representation (1905) to a more basic guide developed by Harry Beck (1933):



<!--1905 http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clive.billson/tubemaps/1905.html




1933 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck#mediaviewer/File:Beck_Map_1933.jpg-->


> He believed that passengers riding the Underground were not too bothered about geographical accuracy, and were more interested in how to get from one station to another and where to change trains.

Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck)


The development of this map became a template for the design of transport maps all over the world such as, Moscow, New York and Washington.


#####Mind the Map

I discovered through a post on [i-am-not-a-celebrity.com](http://i-am-not-a-celebrity.com/2012/05/21/londons-underground-art-scenes/) this was an exhibition in 2012 which explored the journey, identity and publicity of London Transport. Some of the work is interesting:

###Inspired Ideas

Week 2 when we looked at the 'Panel of Hands' Cave Painting it immediatly sparked an idea of doing a modern version of this! So I bought some spray paints and got my Dad (because I realised my long nails would create a weird hand stencil!) to put his hands (gloved) on to a A3 page a couple of different ways while spraying different colours on paint, below shows the finished result:

![Hand Painting](images/hand-art.jpg "Inspired by Cave Paintings")

When we were learning about the design fundamental, Point, through research I discovered Pointillism.

> "Pointillism is a technique in which small, distinct dots of pure color are applied in patterns to form an image"

Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism)

Through searching I found amazing work

This lead me to discover Aboriginal Dot Art which I learned originated from sand drawings:

> The dotting style of many of the Aboriginal artists from this region was a natural evolution from their sand drawings as they translated the stories on the modern materials of paint and canvas.

(Source: [kateowengallery.com](http://www.kateowengallery.com/page/Aboriginal-Dot-Painting.aspx))



<!--image of aborigional art-->


I found it a really interesting style and wanted to try it out for myself, finally I found the time to actually do it!

###James Victore

Breifly we were shown the works of James Victore;

> Unlike a lot of designers who eschew politics in favor of clients and cash, Victore has carved a special niche for himself, yelling loudly about issues that matter to him..."Graphic design has power as tool for change and comment, and people don't take advantage of that enough."

Source: [fastcodesign.com](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662292/the-best-of-james-victore-graphic-designs-rebel-with-a-cause)


> Victore's aesthetic is vanishingly simple: His process involves lots of doodling and he doesn't know much about computers — and that's part of the charm. He's not a naif about making things look nice, but his work most notable for what it actually says. "Unlike most graphic designers, I'm not interested in the spaces between letters and making words look good," he says. "I'm interested in what the words say. I can't be a graphic designer and not comment."

Source: [fastcodesign.com](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662292/the-best-of-james-victore-graphic-designs-rebel-with-a-cause)

We looked at his ['Top Type Tips'](http://trendland.com/james-victores-top-type-rules/):

1. Learn the rules then break them
* Don't Decorate Crap
* There are No Ugly Typefaces
* There is no 'right' font - you are a magician, make your own!
* Sometimes the wrong choice is the best
* Avoid Pull Down Menu tricks
* Technology is not the answer - you are!
* Avoid trends - create your own style!
* Feck Perfection
* Following the rules makes your work the same as everyone else's

I think these are really inspiring guidelines to religiously follow as a designer, so I'll be sure to remind myself of them every so often!



###Revolution & The Bauhaus

WW1 had a large impact on a number of art movements, as designers reacted to what was happening in their work.


####De Stijl

A movement that was a reaction to the trauma of WW1 and founded by Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg.


The movement was inspired by Cubism, consisting of a Geometric and Abstraction style that “simplified visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only primary colours along with black and white.” (Source: [99designs.com](http://99designs.com/designer-blog/2012/12/18/know-your-design-history-the-utopian-de-stijl-movement/))

De Stijl artists also "experimented with three-dimensional figures such as furniture, houses and other similar objects". (Source: [chiaramae.wordpress.com](http://chiaramae.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/de-stijl-part-ii/))

<!--image of red and blue chair and 1921 painting by Piet Mondrain from 99designs.com-->

I discovered the essence of De Stijl can be seen in “the grid” UI layout for Windows 8:


<!--image-->



Theo van Doesburg's early work was influenced by Van Gogh, however, after reading Wassily Kandinsky's book 'Rückblicke' he turned to abstraction. This can be seen in the composition study he did of a cow breaking it down into simple planes:

![Abstract Cow](http://lonelyautodidact.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/4-stages-of-cow.png)

This reminded me of when I was a child, I had a DVD called 'Spirit - The Stallion of the Cimarron':

![DVD Cover](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41io5RLhqbL._SY300_.jpg)

The bonus features included the artist of the animation showing how he sketched the horse, below is an image similar to what was shown on the DVD. The first two images show how the structure of the horse has been broken down into abstract forms.:

![How to draw a horse](http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs35/f/2008/307/2/8/Draw_a_Horse_2_by_Ditroi.jpg)

Doesburg also created a De Stijl typeface, using the geometric concept of the square and a 5x5 grid to work from:

![De Stijl Typeface](http://www.identifont.com/samples/p22/DeStijl.gif)

####Design Revolution

The Russian Revolution had an impact on design, influencing Constructivism and other movements.

Constructivism involves simple geometric shapes and structures, below are some artists from this time:

#####Kazimir Malevich

![The Knife-Grinder 1913](http://www.shafe.co.uk/crystal/images/lshafe/Malevich_The_Knife_Grinder_1912.jpg)

**The Knife-Grinder (1913)**

![Black Square 1915](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/research/2148_10.jpg)

**Black Square (1915)**

#####El Lissitzky

![Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge 1920](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/Artwork_by_El_Lissitzky_1919.jpg)

**Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge (1920)**

This is a personal favourite of mine, I discovered that this was actually a Propaganda poster!


![The Story of the Little Red Square](http://www.citrinitas.com/history_of_viscom/images/avantgarde/PRO01.jpg)


**The Story of the Little Red Square**


![Proun Series](http://www.citrinitas.com/history_of_viscom/images/avantgarde/P93M0021.jpg)

**Proun Series**

I discovered that Lissitzky's work was before the time of programs such as Illustrator or Photoshop that you would be able to generate shapes from, therefore all his work was created by hand!


#####Alexander Rodchenko

A key figure of introducing Photography to Constructivism in an attempt to get messages across:

![Shouting Woman 1924](http://www.boerner.net/jboerner/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/rodchenko0236.jpg)


**Shouting Woman from 'Lilya Brik' poster (1924) **

**Lilya Brik' poster (1924)**

####Bauhaus

An art school in Germany, founded by Walter Gropius, that combined crafts and fine arts, famous for the approach to design that it publicised and taught. (Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus))


Teachers at the Bauhaus:

* **Lyonel Feininger** - the leading artist of Expressionism creating the cover of the Bauhaus publication

**Glass assemblage (1921)**

Later in life Albers explored colour, creating a series of works in 1950 named 'Homeage to the Square' which became world famous:

![Homeage to the Square Prints](http://mysticmedusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Joseph-Albers-Homage-To-The-Square1.jpg)



In 1963 he also published 'The Interaction of Colour', a guide for artists, teachers and students:

Through the years the Bauhaus moved from Weimar 1919, to Dessau in 1925 and was finally taken over by the Natzi's and shut down in 1933.



###Presentation

This week was our group presentations on a selected topic. The group I was part of got the topic of 'Bauhaus and The New Typography'. Straight away I got researching as I didn't really know much about the Bauhaus apart from it was a design school...

I read the chapters of Bauhaus and the New Typography in 'Megg's History of Graphic Design' which helped me get more of an understanding of the topic given. I also searched on the web finding some helpful websites on different areas relating to the main topic:

* [Bauhaus and The New Typography](http://www.historyofgraphicdesign.weareswift.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Week-6-The-Bauhaus-and-the-New-Typography.pdf)
* [Brief Overview of Bauhaus and The New Typography](http://seminaldesign.com/HistoryofVC/20CenturyBauhaus.html)
* [Finding out about Johannes Itten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Itten)
* [Itten's Colour Contrasts](http://www.worqx.com/color/itten.htm)
* [Shneiderman's "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"](http://faculty.washington.edu/jtenenbg/courses/360/f04/sessions/schneidermanGoldenRules.html)
* [Bauhaus Legacy](http://blog.visual.ly/six-lessons-from-the-bauhaus-masters-of-the-persuasive-graphic/)

At the first meeting with the group I shared my knowledge with the group and expressed that I felt the presentation should be divided into sections just like the books and research had. The other members agreed and we spilt the topic into sections, assigning each member a section:

* Intro
* Bauhaus at Weimar
* Impact of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy
* Bauhaus at Dessau
* The Final Years
* Jan Tschichold and The New Typography

The section I was assigned was Jan Tschichold and The New Typography, therefore I began to research this specific area.

My Research included reading books and visiting a lot of websites:

* Christopher Burke Active Literature - Jan Tschichold and New Typography
* Philip B. Meggs. “Meggs' History of Graphic Design.”
* http://guity-novin.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/history-of-type-face.html

* http://www.electrolibrary.com/gdhistory/wp-content/pdf/lectures/hogd_lecture8_slides_sp11.pdf

The way I like to research is to gather information from many resources, combine it and then use this information to be able to write my own version which is easier to understand.

Therefore I copy and paste the information from each website I feel is important to mention, I then use this information as an example to work from to come up with my own version. You can see this method from the document attached below:


* [Document 1](project2/Jan_Tschichold.docx)


To you this might look confusing and a mess, but everyone has their own way of doing things!

I then created a separate document which contained only what I had written, as the more I reworded the harder the document became to work on. When I had my final draft I then began to spilt the paragraphs into different slides and add links to the pictures I aimed to use:


* [Document 2](project2/Jan_Tschichold_New_Typography.docx)


We decided as a group to use Keynote for the presentation, hesitant, as I had never used it before, I decided to make my slides. I quickly got the hang of it and after a couple of hours I became a Keynote fan!

After creating my slides adding my notes, animations, the lot, I thought 'I better check how long I take to present this...' Timing myself, my eyes nearly bulged out of my head realising I seriously needed to cut things out - as we technically only had 2 minutes each to speak as the presentation as a whole is only 10mins!

Therefore I had to condense my notes, which was pretty upsetting for me because I felt like I was cutting out important stuff! However, the topic of the Bauhaus is that large that you could spend a whole presentation on just one tiny part of it.

In terms of the aesthetics of the presentation I felt the cover should include something like the triangle, square and circle I had seen on some images when searching Bauhaus. The reason for this was because it related to what we were learning in another module and I felt it would be something different to the stereotypical Bauhaus Logo that is predictable to use. Mentioning this to the team they agreed.

Through [Research](http://jaced.com/2007/01/04/triangle-square-circle-a-psychological-test/) I discovered that the yellow triangle, red square and blue circle was a “psychological test” Wassily Kandinsky did on his students in 1923, and therefore related to the topic.



My first idea was to just simply have the yellow triangle, red square and blue circle on a white background, no title. However I felt it just looked like no effort was put into it, so I started searching for inspiration on Google Images.

These two images caught my attention:

I liked the way the letter b in the first image was used and the use of lines in the second image. Lines and diagonal type was a recurring theme and iconic to the principals of The New Typography, so I felt it was only appropriate to incorporate it into the cover design.

I sketched some ideas:

[add sketches]

Then I decided to research typefaces. I tried to find out the typefaces mostly used by the Bauhaus (http://fontsinuse.com/uses/5/typefaces-at-the-bauhaus), however, these fonts weren't free. Therefore I decided to search Bauhaus in free font websites and after a couple of downloads found a typeface that closely resembled the second image above.

I liked the designs in the Google Image search that had stretched the Ascender and Descender of letters, therefore I incorporated this into the design.

Below shows the finished product, it was actually only a rough version to show the team, hoping they would provide some feedback or input... but it ended up being the cover. Personally, I'm not overly happy with it, but with the short time-frame I just had to make do.

###Break Poster

Week 5 we were given the task to create posters for the Break Conference using the Plakastil Style. Through the lecture and writing about the style I had gathered research to what the style of poster was like; simple, one image with minimal lettering.

Straight away I had a vision of the main logo of break in the centre of the page, so I sketched this idea along with a few others:


<!--image-->

As you can see they all have the theme of using the range of letter E's used for the Break logo as I felt this was a significant part of the brand.

I then created a few versions on Illustrator:

![Break Poster](images/break-poster1.png)

![Break Poster](images/break-poster2.png)

![Break Poster](images/break-poster3.png)



Through feedback I was advised that the best was the first, and I should develop on it including some information about the Conference such as the date and location, as my design was very minimal. Here are the other versions I created:


![Break Poster](images/break-poster4.png)

![Break Poster](images/break-poster5.png)

![Break Poster](images/break-poster6.png)


To get the exact Break logo I had to screenshot it on the website [breakconf.org](http://breakconf.org) and then Image trace it on Illustrator to get the outlines. This is also how I was able to match the background colour to keep the brand consistant.

For the Typography I used the Google Chrome App 'What Font' to be able to find out the fonts used on the website, Klavika and Elena. As Klavika was Sans-serif I decided to use this for the poster because it would be more legible.

The only problem was that both these fonts are not free, therefore I had to search for a free version that was similar. I came across a post in [typophile.com](http://typophile.com/node/90302) asking the question I wanted to know, and a user suggested Titillium:

![Titillium Typeface](images/titillium.png)


The user provided the website from which I was able to [download the font](http://www.campivisivi.net/archivio/_titillium/titillium2010/download.html) and add to my Illustrator fonts - yay!


###Inspired Ideas

This week I found some time to do some things I've been meaning to for a while now. Week 5 I mentioned Pointalism, and showed a picture of a bird coloured in using blue pen dots. I really wanted to try this so I took advantage of my free time this week to begin it!

I found an image of a bird I liked on Google Images:

![Bird](images/bluebird.jpg)

I didn't realise how sore my hand would get from the millions of tiny dots I had to do! So I only got this far this week:

Week 3 I also mentioned about how I found Marian Bantjes Sugar piece's very inspiring:

Finally I got round to trying it out for myself!

###WW1 & Modernism in the US

Modernism was a movement that was influenced by the Industrial Revolution and the first World War. It is a style that rejected traditional forms such as Realism, in favour of experimentation.

First evolving in Europe through the likes of the Bauhaus, Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius, the domination of Natzi persecusion in Germany led many artists, architechs and designers to flee to America. Bauhaus members such as Gropius and Marcel Breuer taught architecture at Harvard University, Josef and Anni Albers taught at Black Mountain College in North Carolina (teaching the same principals as the Bauhaus) and Moholy-Nagy established 'the New Bauhaus' in Chicago (now known as the Institute of Design).


The characteristics of the Modernist approch include:

* Geometric Shapes
* Primary Colours
* Sans Serif Typography
* Photography
* Asymmetric Page Layout
* Visual Hierarchy

When the insert Jan Tschichold wrote for “Elementare Typographie” (including the principals that would later become 'the New Typography') was publicised to America, there was a shift in the direction of Typography, which led to new typeface designs such as the geometric 'Futura' by Paul Renner.

I discovered that [Futura has a past](http://99designs.com/designer-blog/2012/04/11/know-your-typeface-futuras-amazing-past/), being used for film titles such as '2001: A Space Odyssey' and even walked the moon! (being used as the lettering for the plaque of the first ever moon landing in 1969)

###Ulm School of Design

Back in Germany, the postwar years involved redesigning society, helping to move forward from the devastation left behind. The Ulm School of Design was founded by  Inge Aicher-Scholl, Otl Aicher and Max Bill in 1953; in memory of Inge's siblings who were members of the resistance group "White Rose", executed by the Nazis in 1943.

####Eric Gill

Although mostly known for his typeface design, 'Gill Sans', Eric Gill's career involved architecture and sculptures. An example of this includes 'Ariel and Prospero' from outside the original BBC Broadcasting House building, completed in 1933.




<!--image-->


He also created illustrations and decorative letters for 'The Four Gospels', which is seen as 'one of Gill’s greatest achievements as an illustrator'.(Reference: [utulsa.edu](http://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/news-events-publications/UniversityNews/2014/February/fourgospelsacquisition.aspx))

####Swiss Style

Known as an 'International Typographic Style' that accentuates 'cleanliness, readability and objectivity' using methods such as asymmetric layouts, grids, sans-serif type and typography, similar to the principals of The New Typography.

Pioneers in the development of Graphic design include Josef Müller-Brockmann,
Armin Hofmann, Max Bill and Emil Ruder. Two schools, Zurich School of the Applied Arts (where Josef Müller-Brockmann studied and taught) and The Basel School of Design (Established by Armin Hofmann and Emil Ruder) embraced the principals of Graphic Design and Typography, creating courses that educated students on modern design.

Armin Hofmann spent his career mostly designing posters as he believed it was an efficient form of communication. He also wrote a 'Graphic Design Manual' based on the principals of Graphic Design which is apprechiated by many Graphic Designers.

In England, Jan Tschichold began designing Penguin Book covers, applying strict proportions and refining the logo:


<!--image-->


My personal favourites are the Penguin Scores series which include background patterns from designers such as Stephen Russ, Elizabeth Friedlander and Barbara Lambourne:

<!--image-->


I discovered Rudolph de Harak was one of the first American designers to merge the Swiss style with his own, which can be seen in his book cover designs:

<!--image-->



###American Modernism

In America the ideas of European modernism were first rejected before being embraced. Herbert Matter, starting off in Europe, moved to the US where he practised modern design influenced by American life. His work involved photomontage, for example, his World War II Poster:

<!--image-->

He also produced magazine covers such as Vogue and was a design consultant for Knoll Associates:

<!--image-->


Paul Rand is best known for the logo designs of many corporate identities, such as IBM, ABC and UPS, embracing the Swiss Style in his work and the history of design.

<!--images-->

Saul Bass, who also created logo designs for brands such as Kleenex and Quaker, is best known for his title sequences.

<!--images-->

Before Bass, title sequences were not seen as important and not much effort was put into them. Therefore he is seen as the man that revolutionised the design of the title sequence. His first title sequence, 'The Man with the Golden Arm' in 1955, is what took off his career. He believed the design of the sequence should set a mood and provide a metaphorical story to the subject of the film about to be viewed.


<!--images-->


He also created movie posters such as Vertigo and Anatomy of a Murder:

<!--images-->


There are many contemporary movie posters, such as the the Star Wars series by Olly Moss:

###Pop Art

Pop Art is a movement similar to Dada, challenging the traditions of Fine Art. It includes the features of imagery and material related to mainstream culture, for example, advertising and comic books.

Although Andy Warhol is seen as the key figure of Pop Art I learned through research that the first person to actually produce work that fell into the 'Pop Art' genre was Eduardo Paolozzi. It was his series of 'Bunk!' collages (e.g. I was a Rich Man's Plaything (1947)) presented at the Independant Group in London which influenced the focus on 'pop culture'. (Source of information: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art))

<!--I was a Rich Man's Plaything (1947) image-->


Roy Lichtenstein was known for imitating comic strips using oil and paint to create work with a Pop Art style. An example of his work is 'Drowning Girl', 'taken from the lead story in DC Comics' Secret Hearts #83' that 'features thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots, as if created by photographic reproduction.' (Reference: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art))


<!--image-->

As previously mentioned, Andy Warhol is a well-known figure of Pop Art exploring 'the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture and advertisement'.(Reference: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol))

> It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, mushroom clouds, electric chairs, Campbell's Soup Cans, Coca-Cola bottles, celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando, Troy Donahue, Muhammad Ali, and Elizabeth Taylor

- (Reference: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol))

####Recognised Works


* Coca-Cola bottles - representing democratic equality (Source: [adbranch.com](http://www.adbranch.com/andy-warhols-coca-cola-paintings/))


<!-- image -->

* Marilyn Diptych - tribute to Marilyn Monroe using 'the same publicity photograph from the 1953 film Niagara' (Source: [tate.org.uk](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/warhol-marilyn-diptych-t03093))


<!--image-->


* Campbell's Soup Cans - Warhols work included subjects such as comic strips, however, with Roy Lichtenstein in the same field, he decided he wanted to be different. It was talking to a friend that Warhol was inspired, as they suggested doing something 'everybody recognised, like Campbell’s Soup' (Source: [uk.phaidon.com](http://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2013/february/22/the-fascinating-story-behind-andy-warhols-soup-cans/))


<!--image-->

* The paintings were displayed together on shelves, like products in a grocery aisle, arranged in chronological order of when the soups were introduced. (Source of Information: [moma.org](http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/andy-warhol-campbells-soup-cans-1962))


Through research, I disovered Yayoi Kusama, who was a precursor of Pop Art (as well as other movements) and influenced Andy Warhol. Her work was inspired by 'childhood dreams and visions in which she saw the world covered in polka dots', covering 'paintings, drawings, and sculptures with a repeated, almost obsessive, layer of dots, nets, squiggles, and stickers.' (Refernece: [moma.org](http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=3315))


<!--Yayoi Kusama's Ascension of Polka Dots on the Trees at the Singapore Biennale 2006 on Orchard Road, Singapore image-->

<!--The Obliteration Room 2011-->


<!--Yayoi Kusama . Dots Obsession, 2011-->

Further Research led to finding out that she suffered from mental illness which influenced her work, as 'the colorful and repetitive polka dot patterns that are so common in her pieces are a result of her hallucinations in which patterns leave their objects to cover entire rooms.' (Reference: [melissahuang.com](http://www.melissahuang.com/2012/01/31/women-in-art-yayoi-kusama/))


Milton Glaser, who designed the iconic I Love New York logo in 1977, was inspired by movements such as Art Nouveau, Pop and Op art. An example of this can be seen in the poster he created for Bob Dylan:


<!--images-->


I found a website that posted [Barbie Recreations of Art Classics](http://www.designboom.com/art/barbie-recreations-of-art-classics/) that showcases contemporary versions of famous works including Andy Warhol and Milton Glaser, previously mentioned:
