Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
------

Introduction to what we will be covering over the next 12 weeks.

Not being the biggest fan of history, I learned that I *need* to understand the history of design because it is what has influenced the designs of today and is what will make me a good designer. For example, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html" title="Find out about Johnathan Ive">Jonathan Ive</a>, the Senior Vice President of Design for Apple, who was influenced by <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams" title="Who is Dieter Rams?">Dieter Ram's</a> iconic design for Braun Radio 1961. This inspiration can be seen in apple products, for example, the ET 66 Calculator 1987 and the calculator for the iPhone. Jonathan Ive, and many other designers, swear by Ram's <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design" title="View Ten Principals">'Ten Principals for Good Design'</a> - so I must remind myself of them every now and then!

> “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.” - Confucius

I liked this quote as it not only describes me as I have a head like a sieve, but it explains how the best way to learn is through activly doing. Here is a good post with some more of Confucius quotes with written explaination <a href="http://www.myrkothum.com/confucius-says-the-top-10-quotes-by-confucius/" title="View more Confucius quotes">myrkothum.com</a>.

'Generative Design' was mentioned and I wasn't sure what it was, so I researched it to learn that it is a design method that uses Algorithms (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_Design" title="Find out more about Generative Design">Read more</a>) which is interesting to know for future projects. The importance of side projects was expressed as it is a great way to have fun and be creative, which could end up making you successful like <a href="http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer" title="Who's this?">Jessica Hische</a>!

We were given a 'Type Tile' project, a 3x3 grid of different typefaces from different periods of history. Being a big fan of typeography, I am excited to get stuck into it! After class me and a small group of friends went to the library, which im ashamed to say I have not used before (my bad!) but I decided to get out of my comfort zone as i'm not a huge fan of reading and hire out some books which I thought could help inspire and educate me:

* The Elements of Typographic Style - Robert Bringhurst
* The alphabet and elements of lettering - Goudy, Frederic W.
* Graphis typography 2 : an international selection of the best in typographic

####In the seminar

I was introduced to 'two essential tools for Interaction Designers', <a href="https://atom.io" title="What's Atom?">Atom</a> & <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics" title="What's Markdown?">Markdown</a>. Experiencing coding in the past, Markdown is like heaven! It is a simple way to write whatever you want and using Atom it can be generated into HTML! I must admit it is odd after learning the HTML way...

To get used to Markdown, we were given a task of re-creating a PDF provided to us, below is my attempt (note no CSS is used):


Ireland's rugged coast yields
=============================

Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
------------------------------

###by Robert Sténuit

*Illustrations by National Geographic*

*Photographer Bates Lilttlehales*

A wild north wind lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

> "In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada,the Girona was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called *Port na Spaniagh*, 'the port of the Spaniards'."

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

**Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:**

* A ornamental winged salamander
* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta
* Gilded brass dolphin
* Lapis lazuli cameos
* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats

**The Author:** Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in **"The Deepest Days"**, National Geographic, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.

* Working with limitations will expand your creativity e.g. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/wp9p" title="About Album">Nils Fraham - Screws</a>

###Branding

* Keep it simple - less is more
* Always refer back to the brief
* Sketch initial ideas - quicker than computer

###Cave Paintings

We were shown 'The Panel of Hands' which were cave paintings in Spain where paint was blown over the hand while it was pressed against stone. This sparked an idea in my mind for a little experiment/side project! We were also shown cave paintings where dots had been used to create an image - this related to the design fundamental 'point' we had been learning this week! Through research it was dicovered these paintings are thought to be'the earliest examples of pointillism', an example of this type of painting is <a href="http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/chauvet/red_dots_panel.php" title="View source of information">'Red Dots Panel'</a>.

We looked at proportioning e.g. the Vitruvian Man & the Golden Ratio which is very important for giving a design balance and beauty. Through research I discovered that the Golden Ratio is also seen in nature, art and architecture such as 'The Last Supper' painting, the 'Great Pyraminds' in Egypt and 'The Parthenon' in Greece (<a href="http://www.goldennumber.net/golden-section/" title="View source">Source of information</a>).

The Golden Ratio can also be seen in logos such as Apple and Twitter, and we were shown the <a href="http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/seed-logo/" title="View the logo">logo design</a> of 'Seed Media Group' that Stefen Sagmeister created using the Golden Ratio and nature as inspiration. It too, reminded me of the design fundamental, point, as it is just circles! I really like how Sagmeister also created variations of the logo using different colours, for example, the business cards are pixel-like portraits of the employees through using various coloured dots.

I refreshed my memory by re-reading '<a href="http://typecast.com/blog/contrast-through-scale" title="View article">Contrast Through Scale</a> by Christopher Murphy' which explains how we can use these tools to define a hierarchy to guide the reader's eye through content on a page and provide a visual balance. The websites <a href="http://modularscale.com" title="View">modularscale.com</a> and <a href="http://type-scale.com" title="View">type-scale.com</a> are two handy ways of calculating the scale of type to provide that balance.

Through an overveiw of the <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2010/08/07/where-does-the-alphabet-come-from/" title="View website">history of the alphabet/written word</a>, I learned that the written word developed from pictorial to abstract and the Trajan typeface was based on the Roman square capitals inscripted on Trajan's Column. In an activity naming the fonts on screen during the lecture I came across some fonts that interested me:

* <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Raden_Segara_(Madurese_in_Javanese_script-published_in_1890)_(cropped).jpg" title="View font">Javanese Script</a>

* <a href="http://www.fonts2u.com/ws-simple-gallifreyan.font" title="View font">Galafren</a> - (CIRCLES!)

* <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/americas/2012/10/james-evans-and-the-cree-syllabary.html" title="View font">Cree syllabics by James Evans</a>

We looked at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_books" title="More info">history of books</a> and through research I discovered various materials that were used to write on , such as wooden tablets, silk, shell, bone and dried palm tree leaves. I learned that the book developed from writing on clay tablets, to Papyrus (in Egypt), Bamboo (in East Asia - for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War" title="View">The Art of War</a>), which was replaced by Parchment and finally Paper in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex" title="What's codex?">codex</a> replaced the scroll.

Moving on to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript" title="Find out more">Illuminated Manuscripts</a> we looked at the conservation of books, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria" title="Find out more">Library of ALexandria</a> being mentioned which was 'one of the largest and most significant' that became famous for being burned to the ground destroying many scrolls and books.

Scriptoriums were another form of conserving books as they were a place monks would copy and decorate manuscripts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells" title="Find out more">The Book of Kells</a> is an example of a famous Illuminated Manuscript, which inspired ideas for the 'Type Tile' project.

With the increased demand of distribution of books, the method of printing needed to develop in order to be faster and more efficient, which brings us to the topic of next week's lecture.

> The printing press is considered one of the most important inventions in history. This device has made it possible for books, newspapers, magazines, and other reading materials to be produced in great numbers - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_printing" title="View source">Wikipedia</a>

'Movable Type' was first developed in China, 1040. In 1450  Johannes Gutenberg improved the system casting type using a matrix and hand mould which produced quick, low cost, high quality prints.

The first book printed using 'Movable Type' was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible">The Gutenburg Bible</a>.

* I learnt that the term leading came from the method of casting type "when thin strips of lead were inserted into the forms to increase the vertical distance between lines of type" - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading" title="View source">Wikipedia</a>

<!-- Insert image http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_printing#mediaviewer/File:Metal_movable_type.jpg-->

Albrecht Durer was mentioned who used Woodcuts as one of the methods for his work. It was mentioned that he added his monogram onto some of his work, which can be seen as an early form of branding. 

He created a book, 'A Course in the Art of Measurement with Compass and Ruler' which goes into depth about font & proportions, which could be an interesting read.
