Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1

Introduction to what we will be covering over the next 12 weeks.

Not being the biggest fan of history, I learned that I *need* to understand the history of design because it is what has influenced the designs of today and is what will make me a good designer. For example, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html" title="Find out about Johnathan Ive">Jonathan Ive</a>, the Senior Vice President of Design for Apple, who was influenced by <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams" title="Who is Dieter Rams?">Dieter Ram's</a> iconic design for Braun Radio 1961. This inspiration can be seen in apple products, for example, the ET 66 Calculator 1987 and the calculator for the iPhone. Jonathan Ive, and many other designers, swear by Ram's <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design" title="View Ten Principals">'Ten Principals for Good Design'</a> - so I must remind myself of them every now and then!

> “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.” - Confucius

I liked this quote as it not only describes me as I have a head like a sieve, but it explains how the best way to learn is through activly doing. Here is a good post with some more of Confucius quotes with written explaination <a href="http://www.myrkothum.com/confucius-says-the-top-10-quotes-by-confucius/" title="View more Confucius quotes">myrkothum.com</a>.

'Generative Design' was mentioned and I wasn't sure what it was, so I researched it to learn that it is a design method that uses Algorithms (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_Design" title="Find out more about Generative Design">Read more</a>) which is interesting to know for future projects. The importance of side projects was expressed as it is a great way to have fun and be creative, which could end up making you successful like <a href="http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer" title="Who's this?">Jessica Hische</a>!

We were given a 'Type Tile' project, a 3x3 grid of different typefaces from different periods of history. Being a big fan of typeography, I am excited to get stuck into it! After class me and a small group of friends went to the library, which im ashamed to say I have not used before (my bad!) but I decided to get out of my comfort zone as i'm not a huge fan of reading and hire out some books which I thought could help inspire and educate me:

* The Elements of Typographic Style - Robert Bringhurst
* The alphabet and elements of lettering - Goudy, Frederic W.
* Graphis typography 2 : an international selection of the best in typographic

####In the seminar

I was introduced to 'two essential tools for Interaction Designers', <a href="https://atom.io" title="What's Atom?">Atom</a> & <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics" title="What's Markdown?">Markdown</a>. Experiencing coding in the past, Markdown is like heaven! It is a simple way to write whatever you want and using Atom it can be generated into HTML! I must admit it is odd after learning the HTML way...

To get used to Markdown, we were given a task of re-creating a PDF provided to us, below is my attempt (note no CSS is used):


Ireland's rugged coast yields
=============================

Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
------------------------------

###by Robert Sténuit

A wild north wind lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

> "In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada,the Girona was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called *Port na Spaniagh*, 'the port of the Spaniards'."

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

**Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:**

* A ornamental winged salamander
* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta
* Gilded brass dolphin
* Lapis lazuli cameos
* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats

**The Author:** Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in **"The Deepest Days"**, National Geographic, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.
